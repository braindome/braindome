Greetings!
My name is Antonio. Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, I'm a language teacher (English, Swedish and Italian - my first language) turned security guard, on his way to become a mobile app developer.
I'm currently studying a 2-year program at Folkuniversitetet Göteborg where I'm learning the basics of programming with Java, Kotlin and Swift.
I will be using my GitHub as a journal and milestone keeper into this journey. So make yourself at home and feel free to look around!
